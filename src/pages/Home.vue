      This project is a web app that allows users to customize prints for flyers, posters, and business cards. Users are
      able to select from a variety of options such as size, material, and print type. Additionally, the app includes
      logic to exclude certain options when they are not available for combination. Also, it involves implementing
      conditional statements and data validation to ensure the user's choices are valid
